		Hello! I'm a hobbyist programmer and 3D artist who goes by 'cellomonster' on the internet. I'm 19 years old, live in the Midwestern United States, and will soon be studying electrical/computer engineering at Purdue University. Welcome to my webpage! Its the place I use to catalog all the stuff I scatter around the internet. It's a tad self indulgent, but what else are personal sites for?
