		Website info
	</h2>

	<p>
		This site was written from scratch, half out of being too prideful to use a template, and half out of wanting to learn to build sites. It likely breaks many conventions and best practices in web design, but its functional.

        I have a bone to pick with lots of modern websites. They try to act like apps or fancy slideshows, sacrificing ease of navigation for aesthetics and leading to the power-hungry behemoths that are modern web browsers. <a href="https://www.electronjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We've even gotten to the point where webpages and apps are the same thing!</a> Webpages are supposed to be like documents; mostly static with a focus on content. I built this site to reflect those ideals.

		I use  
		<a href="https://www.exljbris.com/museoslab.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exljbris Font Foundry's Museo Slab</a>
		for heading text and  
		<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastian Kosch's Crimson Text</a>
		for everything else. I don't know if these font choices obey whatever typography fundamentals in web design there are. I just eyeballed it, thinking they look nice :)
