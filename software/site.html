		Website info

	<p>
		This site was written from scratch, half out of being too prideful to use a template, and half out of wanting to learn to build sites. It likely breaks many many best practices in web design, but its functional.

	<p>
		I use  
		<a href="https://www.exljbris.com/museoslab.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exljbris Font Foundry's handsome Museo Slab font</a>
		for heading text and  
		<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastian Kosch's crisp Crimson Text font</a>
		for everything else. I don't know if these font choices obey whatever typography fundamentals in web design there are. I just eyeballed it, thinking they look nice :)
