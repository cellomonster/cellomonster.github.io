		I attended the Carnegie Mellon National High School Game Academy between my sophomore and junior years of high school. There, I was assigned to lead a team of artists and developers and build a VR game. We chose to create a game where the player must escape from a crumbling space station.

		I was responsible for some code and all of the 3D artwork, animation, and lighting. The final game was incredibly unoptimized with crazy high vertex counts, draw calls, and lights placed everywhere to simulate GI. Part of this was due to inexperience, and part of it due to having less than a month to build the game. I'm still very proud of the final result, and it wouldn't have been possible without the other team members' hard work :)
